As an architect with a very abstract definition of architecture, I believe that the combination of design and technical thinking prepares you with a set of tools that allow a pursuit in a number of different disciplines. 

### Always making things
I started to learn software development by chance. After a few lines of HTML I was hooked. I believe programming is dynamic and iterative, technical and creative. Code gives you the ability to build beautiful things, to bring your ideas into fruition.


### The joy of always learning
For almost two years now, I have enjoyed the process of continuous learning while creating. Be it a simple method to count the words in a string, a command line application or a sinatra MVC web application. 
I have lost track of time trying to understand a problem to find a possible solution, asking myself: why does this not work? why does this work?! Curiosity has always driven me to keep asking questions and keep trying solutions. And it's been an absolutely rewarding journey.


### A great community
A community that thrives in sharing ideas and helping each other grow. 
Be it through sharing experiences, having discussions and debates, asking questions.


### Endless possibilities
Programming is the backbone to so many aspects of our daily lives and I am still fascinated by the endless possibilities it brings. There is no limit to this continuous learning. Languages, tools, algorithms, frameworks, patterns, always growing and evolving.
